        <h2>Bio</h2>

        <p>
          I started out in the newbie zone in Santa Barbara, California. I had min-maxed my stats to be very intelligent, both
          mentally and emotionally, but balanced out with asthma, which was extremely physically limiting, and depression, 
          which was emotionally and mentally limiting. Fortunately, my randomly generated party was made up of two amazing parents 
          and four incredible siblings.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Before I had finished the newbie zone, my parents relocated the party up to the Oregon coast to a small town called 
          Tillamook. I finished up the newbie zone right around the age of 18, and decided level in college next. College didn't 
          go so well. The problem was that I was more focused on leveling my emotional skills in relationsps than I was in improving
          my mental skills in classes. That the college leveling zone was so focused on mental skills made this nearly impossible.
          I went back to the newbie zone to figure something else out. I repeated this mistake several times.
        </p>

        <p>
          It ended up taking me several years of on-and-off courses to gradute college, but I finally did it. I got a B.S. 
          in philosophy, which had thoroughly taught me that reason and argument are equally as effective and valid as 
          physically forcing someone to do something; in general, both are simply matters of convincing the other person that 
          the argument or fight isn't worth the trouble. This doesn't determine who is right; only who is more skilled
          at argument/fighting.
        </p>

        <p>
          I continued leveling my emotional skills as much as possible. There were many adventures and failures, some worthy 
          of becoming stories, some less so. It wasn't until I started to notice that no one else was leveling alongside me
          that I realized that I had very nearly reached the maximum level my current environment had to offer. It was also
          around that time that I discovered that emotional skills, no matter how high level, do not make a lot of money.
          At least, not without the appropriate corrosponding mental skills.
        </p>

        <p>
          That brings us to now. Now, I'm grinding my mental skills in web engineering in order to reach a place of financial 
          stability, at which point I can more easily access higher level content.

              I know rudimentary HTML and CSS, and used those skills to work for a professor shortly after I graduated
              college. I'm currently enrolled in an intensive coding bootcamp at Alchemy Code Lab.

          <dt>Executive Assistant</dt>
            <dd>
              I've worked as an executive and/or administrative assistant both professionaly and as a volunteer with 
              multiple companies. Professionally I worked witht he Conference of Delegates of CA Bar Associations and 
              the Secondary Special Education and Transition team at the University of Oregon. I've also volunteered with 
              Tillamook County Outdoor School and JamBallah Northwest Bellydance Festival numerous times each.
            </dd>

          <dt>Customer Service</dt>
            <dd>I worked with Simple Finance for 2.5 years as a customer service agent. I eventually reached 
              a lower management position. I also worked at the computer lab help desk at the Knight Library while 
              I was attending the U of O.
            </dd>
            
          <dt>Energy Healing</dt>
            <dd>
              My biggest projects with energy healing have involved the Gender Wars, for which I have acted as front-line 
              soldier as well as in an advisory capacity. I've provided immediate support for a priestest during her 
              tumultuous initiation, though my involvement ended traumatically. I served as a third-density advisor during 
              the nuclear war negotiations a few years ago. Currenty I regularly meet with a group of humans and provide a 
              soft-channel of Ra to teach/learn.
