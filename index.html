        <h1>About Me</h1>
        
        <h2>Bio</h2>

        <p>
          My avatar spawned in Santa Barbara, California. I had min-maxed my stats to be very intelligent, both
          mentally and emotionally, but balanced out by asthma, which was extremely physically limiting; and depression, 
          which was emotionally and mentally limiting. Fortunately, my initial party was made up of two amazing parents 
          and four siblings.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Before I had finished the newbie zone, my parents directed the party up to the Oregon coast to a small town called 
          Tillamook. I finished up the newbie zone by the time I was 18, and decided to keep leveling in college. College didn't 
          go so well, so I went back to the newbie zone to figure something else out. I did this several times. The problem was 
          that I was trying to level up my emotional skills in relationships, but was told by everyone else to focus on my 
          mental skills in classes.
        </p>

        <p>
          It ended up taking me several years of on-and-off courses to graduate college, but I finally did it. I got a B.S. 
          in philosophy, which had thoroughly taught me that reason and argument are equally as effective and valid as 
          physically forcing someone to do something; in general both are simply matters of convincing the other person that 
          it's just not worth arguing/fighting with you. Or, in extreme cases, removing their option to do so at all.
        </p>

        <p>
          I continued leveling my emotional skills as much as possible. There were many adventures and failures, some worthy 
          of becoming stories, some less so. It wasn't until I started to notice that no one else 
          was leveling alongside me that I realized that I had very nearly reached max level. At least, I was no longer able 
          to easily find the zones that were high enough level for me to continue to advance. It was also around that time 
          that I discovered that emotional skills, no matter how high level, do not make a lot of money.
        </p>

        <p>
          That brings us to now. Now, I'm grinding my mental skills in web engineering in order to reach a place of financial 
          stability, at which point I can more easily access higher level content.

        <h2>Job Experience</h2>
        <dl>
          <dt>Coding</dt>
            <dd>
              I know rudimentary HTML and CSS, and used those skills to work for a professor shortly after I graduated
              college. I'm currently enrolled in an intensive coding bootcamp at Alchemy Code Lab.
            </dd>
          <dt>Executive Assistant</dt>
            <dd>
              I've worked as an executive and/or administrative assistant both professionally and as a volunteer with 
              multiple companies. Professionally I worked with the Conference of Delegates of California Bar Associations and 
              the Secondary Special Education and Transition team at the University of Oregon. I've also volunteered with 
              Tillamook County Outdoor School and JamBallah Northwest Bellydance Festival numerous times each.
            </dd>
          <dt>Customer Service</dt>
            <dd>I worked with Simple Finance for two and a half years as a customer service agent. I eventually reached 
              a lower management position. I also worked at the computer lab help desk at the Knight Library while 
              I was attending the U of O.
            </dd>
          <dt>Energy Healing</dt>
            <dd>
              My biggest projects with energy healing have involved the Gender Wars, for which I have acted as front-line 
              soldier as well as in an advisory capacity. I've provided immediate support for a priestess during her 
              tumultuous initiation, though my involvement ended traumatically for us both. I served as a third-density advisor during 
              the nuclear war negotiations a few years ago. Currenty I regularly meet with a group of humans and provide a 
              soft-channel of Ra to teach/learn.
